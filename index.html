<h1>Privacy Policy for ChippyMan Pro</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 12 February 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.</p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>ChippyMan Pro is a professional tool designed for carpenters and tradespeople. The App is intended for business use and does not require users to create an account.</p>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how data is handled.</p>

<h3>2.2 Subscription and Payments</h3>

<h3>2.3 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
<p>The App does not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Collect analytics data</li>
  <li>Use tracking technologies</li>
  <li>Use advertising SDKs</li>
  <li>Collect device location</li>
  <li>Access contacts or media without your action</li>
</ul>

<p>Standard technical data may be processed by Google Play as part of app distribution and billing.</p>

<h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device.</p>
<p>You are responsible for managing backups of your data if applicable.</p>
<p>We do not store or back up your job data on external servers.</p>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.</p>

<p>The only third-party service involved is Google Play, which handles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>App distribution</li>
  <li>Subscription billing</li>
  <li>License verification</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>Because data is stored locally on your device, security depends on your device’s security settings.</p>

<p>We recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using device-level security (PIN, password, biometrics)</li>
  <li>Keeping your device updated</li>
</ul>

<h2>6. Your Rights (UK & EU Users)</h2>
<p>If you are located in the UK or EU, you have rights under applicable data protection laws, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The right to access personal data</li>
  <li>The right to request deletion</li>
  <li>The right to restrict processing</li>
</ul>

<p>As we do not collect or store personal data on external servers, most data control is managed directly on your device.</p>
