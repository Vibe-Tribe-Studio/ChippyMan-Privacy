## 1. Introduction

ChippyMan Pro (“the App”) is a professional productivity tool for carpenters and tradespeople, developed by **VibeTribeStudio** (“we”, “us”, “our”).

We take privacy seriously. ChippyMan Pro is designed to minimise data collection and operate **offline-first**, with all core data stored locally on your device.

This Privacy Policy explains:
- what data is (and is not) collected
- how data is stored and used
- your rights under UK data protection law

## 2. Data Controller

For the purposes of UK data protection law, the data controller is:

**VibeTribeStudio**  
Contact: vtribestudio@gmail.com

## 3. Data We Do NOT Collect

ChippyMan Pro does **not**:
- require user accounts
- collect analytics or usage tracking
- collect personal data to external servers
- access your contacts
- access your location
- transmit customer or business data off your device
- include advertising or third-party tracking SDKs

We do **not** operate cloud services or databases for user data.

## 4. Data Stored Locally on Your Device

All app data is stored **locally on your device only**. This may include:

### Business Data (entered by you)
- company details
- pricing settings
- material cost data
- labour rates
- saved preferences

### Customer & Job Data (entered by you)
- customer names and contact details
- addresses

### App-Generated Data
- calculations
- saved project summaries
- locally generated PDFs or exports
- internal identifiers

This data **never leaves your device** unless you explicitly share it.

---

## 5. Photos & Attachments

If enabled, the App may allow you to:
- take photos of work
- attach images to project records

These images:
- are stored locally on your device
- are not uploaded or shared automatically
- remain fully under your control

---

## 6. Permissions Used

ChippyMan Pro requests only the permissions necessary to function.

### Notifications
- Used to show reminders or alerts related to jobs
- Generated locally on your device

### Storage / Media (Optional)
- Used to attach photos
- Used to export or share PDFs or job summaries
- No files are uploaded automatically

ChippyMan Pro does **not** require Internet permission for core functionality.

---

## 7. Data Sharing

We do not share your data with third parties.

Data is only shared when **you explicitly choose to do so**, for example:
- emailing a quote
- exporting a job summary
- sharing a file via another app
- printing via Android print services

These actions use Android’s system share functionality.

---

## 8. Subscriptions & Payments

Subscriptions are handled entirely by **Google Play Billing**.

We do not:
- receive your payment details
- store card or billing information
- access your Google account information

Google processes payments according to its own privacy policy.

---

## 9. Data Retention

We do not define retention periods because:
- all data is controlled by you
- data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App

You are responsible for:
- backing up your device
- exporting records if required for business or legal compliance

---

## 10. Data Security

We take reasonable steps to ensure the App stores data securely on your device.

However, you are responsible for:
- securing your device
- using screen locks or device encryption
- preventing unauthorised access

We are not responsible for data loss caused by:
- device failure
- theft
- malware
- operating system changes

---

## 11. Your Rights (UK GDPR)

Under UK GDPR, you have rights including:
- the right to access your data
- the right to correct inaccurate data
- the right to delete your data

Because data is stored locally:
- you can exercise these rights directly within the App
- deleting records or uninstalling the App removes your data

---

## 12. Children’s Privacy

ChippyMan Pro is not intended for use by children.

We do not knowingly collect data from anyone under the age of 16.

---

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

If changes are made:
- the updated policy will be available within the App
- the “last updated” date will be revised
